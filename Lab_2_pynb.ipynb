        "The Red Dragon Inn is an online Dungeons and Dragons community, connecting players worldwide. In this lab, you will develop a tool that helps users calculate the probabilities of specific events occurring during gameplay, enhancing their strategic planning. For instance, users may wish to calculate the probability of the sum of two six-sided dice being 10 or more. In Dungeons and Dragons, the notation mdn denotes the process of rolling m dice, each with n sides. Here, rolling two six-sided dice is expressed as 2d6, and rolling three eight-sided dice is denoted by 3d8. You are tasked with creating a utility to assist players in the following two scenarios:\n",
